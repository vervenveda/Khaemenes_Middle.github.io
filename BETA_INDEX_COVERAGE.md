## Coverage rule

Public HTML surfaces whose filenames end in `index.html` (including `_index.html` and common `inndex.html` typos) receive the canonical `/assets/vnv-beta-link.js` doorway unless they are archived/private or explicitly forbid all scripts.

The Beta widget sends only the public hostname and pathname as source metadata. It does not send learner IDs, family IDs, grades, answers, form values, query strings, hashes, localStorage contents, or credentials.
